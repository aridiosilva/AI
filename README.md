# Machine Learning  

![Machine Learning Segments](https://github.com/aridiosilva/AI/blob/main/machine-learning-topics-as.png)

- **Unsupervised Learning** - *Is a type of algorithm that learns patterns from untagged data. The hope is that through mimicry, the machine is forced to build a compact internal representation of its world*
- **Supervised Learning** - *Is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. ... In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal).*
- **Reinforcement Learning** - *Is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.*

# Data Science 

Data analysis and machine learning have become an integrative part of the modern scientific methodology, offering automated procedures for the prediction of a phenomenon based on past observations, unraveling underlying patterns in data and providing insights about the problem. Yet, caution should avoid using machine learning as a black-box tool, but rather consider it as a methodology, with a rational thought process that is entirely dependent on the problem under study. In particular, the use of algorithms should ideally require a reasonable understanding of their mechanisms, properties and limitations, in order to better apprehend and interpret their results.
