# PCA - Principal Component Analysis 

In data science, one of the most often used **linear model** to extract information from data is **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. We need to learn about what PCA is and how PCA can be useful for you in term of:

   -- data preprocessing, 
   -- feature extraction, 
   -- dimensional reduction, and 
   -- data visualization.  
   
Note: Basic knowledge on Linear Algebra is necessary to understand the numerical examples and concepts involved.
